# Startup Project

This is the GitHub repo for an iOS app that I was making for a startup company based in the US.


## Story Time

Initially, I was asked to create a prototype version of their Android app in iOS within a week.
However, since I finished the given task within 2 days the demands kept building. I was then asked to integrate
the authentication backend using Firebase then implement POSTing of documents to Firebase storage which
I gladly did even though I knew I was doing more than I was going to be paid for.
Finally, at the end of the week, they had gotten a pretty functional iOS app out of me.
On the last call, before I quit, I was asked to send the .ipa file over to them using illegitimate means.
I strongly disagreed to that since I didn't want to go against my Apple Developer Contract.
I was then shouted at for suggesting that an app with Static Screens depicting "Page under construction"
will be rejected by the App Store review team for violating their "Incomplete App" guideline.
All of this tipped me to my breaking point and I politely asked if I could quit and take my compensation.
They said I can leave and they will not pay me since they didn't like the changes I made to the iOS app's UI
and since it didn't look exactly like the Android UI with a hamburger menu; even though I had sent them a 
screen-recording video of the UI on the very first day.

## Lesson

### Never trust a startup unless you know who you're working with. You'll end up being exploited.

## Conclusion

### Well, since I didn't get my compensation here's my iOS project showcasing what I did in one week.
